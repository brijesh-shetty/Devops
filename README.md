## Lab 01: Nginx Pod on Kubernetes

**Folder:** [`01-Nginx-Pod/`](./01-Nginx-Pod/)

Deployed an Nginx web server as a Kubernetes Pod on Minikube and exposed it using a `NodePort` Service. Verified HTTP access via `kubectl port-forward`.

**Key Steps:**
- Started Minikube and verified cluster health
- Deployed Nginx pod using `kubectl run`
- Exposed pod via NodePort Service
- Accessed Nginx welcome page at `http://localhost:8080`

---

## Lab 02: Flask App on Minikube

**Folder:** [`02-Kubectl-Flask/`](./02-Kubectl-Flask/)

Deployed a Python Flask application on Minikube using YAML manifests. Understood the difference between `port` and `targetPort`, and why a Service is needed for external access.

**Key Steps:**
- Built Flask Docker image inside Minikube's Docker daemon (`eval $(minikube docker-env)`)
- Applied `Deployment` YAML with `imagePullPolicy: Never`
- Added `NodePort` Service to the manifest
- Accessed app via `minikube service flask-app-service --url`

---

## Lab 03: ReplicaSet Scaling

**Folder:** [`03-Minikube-Scaling/`](./03-Minikube-Scaling/)

Deployed a Flash Sale e-commerce simulation app using a Kubernetes ReplicaSet. Scaled from 3 → 5 replicas and observed automatic self-healing when a pod was deleted.

**Key Steps:**
- Started Minikube with `--nodes=1`
- Applied ReplicaSet + Service YAML (3 initial replicas)
- Scaled to 5 replicas with `kubectl scale rs flashsale-rs --replicas=5`
- Deleted a pod and observed automatic replacement

---

## Lab 04: Docker Networking

**Folder:** [`04-Docker-Networking/`](./04-Docker-Networking/)

Created a custom Docker bridge network and connected Flask, MySQL, and Redis containers on it. Verified that containers can communicate using DNS names instead of IP addresses.

**Key Steps:**
- Created bridge network: `docker network create --driver bridge my-bridge-net`
- Launched 3 containers on the same network
- Exec'd into Flask container and pinged mysql/redis by name
- Confirmed DNS-based container-to-container communication

---

## Lab 05: Docker Security

**Folder:** [`05-Docker-Security/`](./05-Docker-Security/)

Secured a Docker container using an AppArmor profile that restricts access to `/etc/`, `/var/`, and binary execution. Used the Docker SDK for Python to apply and verify the profile.

**Key Steps:**
- Wrote `my-apparmor-profile` restricting sensitive paths and capabilities
- Loaded the profile: `sudo apparmor_parser -r ...`
- Ran container with `--security-opt="apparmor=my-apparmor-profile"`
- Verified restrictions using `test_restricted_actions.py` (Exit Code 1/126 for blocked ops)

---

## Lab 06: Grafana Real-Time Monitoring

**Folder:** [`06-Grafana-Monitoring/`](./06-Grafana-Monitoring/)

Built a real-time delivery operations monitoring stack for ZAPPTTO using Python (prometheus_client), Prometheus, and Grafana. Configured alerting rules that fired when pending delivery thresholds were exceeded.

**Key Steps:**
- Wrote `delivery_metrics.py` exposing Gauge and Summary metrics on port 8000
- Ran Prometheus with `prometheus.yml` + `alert_rules.yml` via Docker
- Ran Grafana and connected Prometheus as a data source
- Created dashboard panels for total/pending/on-the-way deliveries and avg delivery time
- Verified `HighPendingDeliveries` and `HighAverageDeliveryTime` alerts firing in Prometheus UI
- `Jenkinsfile` + `Dockerfile` provided for full stack automation via Jenkins

**Monitoring Stack:**

| Service | URL | Purpose |
|---------|-----|---------|
| Metrics Endpoint | `http://localhost:8000/metrics` | Live Prometheus metrics |
| Prometheus UI | `http://localhost:9090` | Queries, targets, alerts |
| Grafana Dashboard | `http://localhost:3000` | Real-time visualizations |

## Lab 07: Jenkins & CI Introduction

**Folder:** [`07-Jenkins-Pipeline/`](./07-Jenkins-Pipeline/)

Studied Continuous Integration concepts and installed Jenkins using Docker. Covered key CI features, benefits, common CI/CD tools (GitLab CI, CircleCI, Travis CI, Bamboo, TeamCity, GitHub Actions), and core Jenkins concepts.

**Key Steps:**
- Ran Jenkins via Docker: `docker run -d -p 8080:8080 jenkins/jenkins:lts`
- Retrieved initial admin password and unlocked Jenkins at `http://localhost:8080`
- Installed suggested plugins and created admin user

---

## Lab 08: Hello World Jenkins Job

**Folder:** [`08-HelloWorld-Jenkins/`](./08-HelloWorld-Jenkins/)

Created a Jenkins Freestyle job that pulls a shell script from GitHub and executes it. Demonstrated SCM integration and basic Jenkins job configuration.

**Key Steps:**
- Created GitHub repository `devops-sample-code` and pushed `hello-world.sh`
- Configured Freestyle job with Git SCM and shell build step (`sh hello-world.sh`)
- Built the job and verified "Hello, Jenkins!" in the console output

---

## Lab 09: Jenkins Multi-Stage Pipeline

**Folder:** [`09-Jenkins-MultiStage/`](./09-Jenkins-MultiStage/)

Designed and ran a Jenkins declarative pipeline with 5 stages for a Python Flask application: **Build → Test → Deploy → Run Application → Test Application**. Resolved missing Python dependencies inside the Jenkins container.

**Key Steps:**
- Pushed Flask app, unit tests, and `Jenkinsfile` to GitHub
- Created Jenkins Pipeline job with "Pipeline script from SCM"
- Resolved `python3`/`pip` dependencies inside Jenkins container via `docker exec`
- All 5 stages completed with `Finished: SUCCESS`

---

## Lab 10: Kubernetes Multi-Node Cluster

**Folder:** [`10-Kubernetes-MultiNode/`](./10-Kubernetes-MultiNode/)

Deployed two Flask microservices (Product Catalog and Shopping Cart) on a 3-node Minikube cluster. Used pod anti-affinity rules to ensure pods from the same service are scheduled on different nodes.

**Key Steps:**
- Started 3-node cluster: `minikube start --nodes 3 -p devops-multinode`
- Built and loaded Docker images for both services into Minikube
- Applied Deployments (2 replicas for Catalog, 3 for Cart) with `podAntiAffinity`
- Verified pods spread across `devops-multinode`, `devops-multinode-m02`, `devops-multinode-m03`
- Tested APIs via `curl` — product list and cart add/retrieve working
